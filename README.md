A cross platform desktop app wrapping [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) with media keys support and preventing interruptions.

This application is built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and the latest version of Chromium wich allows you to use the media keys (play, pause, previous, next, etc.) to control playback. That means you can hit "play" or "pause" button on your keyboard, MacBook Pro Touch Bar or bluetooth headphone. :headphones:

### Additional features:

- Skip video ads by going to the end of the video when they appear.
- Simulate human activity every 5 minutes to prevent the "Video paused. Continue watching?" confirmation.
