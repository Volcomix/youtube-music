A standalone Electron app wrapping Youtube Music with media keys support and skipping ads.

This application is built with the latest version of Chromium wich allows you to use the media keys (play, pause, previous, next, etc.) to control playback. That means you can hit "play" or "pause" button on your keyboard, MacBook Pro Touch Bar or bluetooth headphone. :headphones:
